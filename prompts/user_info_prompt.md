the important data for you to pay attention will usually be in the user messages, and the "content": area.

      "content": "Hi im Simon", <-----This is user information, we need to extract it
      "metadata": {

    {

      "content": "Nice to meet you, Simon! What hobbies or interests do you have? Any favorite books, movies, or games you'd like to share? <self_reflection>\"Engaging with Simon to build a more personalized interaction.\"</self_reflection>",
      "metadata": {
        "consolidated": false
      }
    },

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "user_info": [
    {
      "type": "name",
      "value": "John Doe"
    },
    {
      "type": "occupation",

    },
    {

    }
  ]
}

If you can't find any user information, return an empty array for "user_info".
