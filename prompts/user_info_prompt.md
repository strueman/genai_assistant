    {
        "category": "Personal Details",
        "subcategory": "Name",
        "value": "John Doe",
        "confidence": 0.9,
        "source": "User directly stated their name"
    },
    {

Guidelines:
1. Prioritize accuracy and relevance over quantity.
2. Assign a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) based on how certain you are about the information.
3. Provide a brief source or context for each piece of information.
4. Focus on information freely shared by the user, like "My name is John Doe".
5. If conflicting information is found, include both entries with appropriate confidence scores.
6. Ignore role-playing or hypothetical scenarios unless they clearly reflect the user's real preferences or experiences.
7. Pay attention to subtle cues and implied information, but assign lower confidence scores to these inferences.

Examples of Valuable User Data:
1. "I'm Sarah, a 28-year-old software engineer living in Seattle."
2. "I've always dreamed of starting my own eco-friendly clothing line."
3. "Heights terrify me, but I'm determined to overcome this fear."
4. "My partner and I are saving up to buy our first house next year."
5. "I volunteer at the local animal shelter every month because I'm passionate about animal welfare."

Examples of Less Relevant Information:
1. "The weather was nice today."
2. "I had a sandwich for lunch."
3. "The AI told me a joke about a chicken crossing the road."
4. The provided content is technical and does not contain personal information or insights about the users identity
5. Understanding HTML to string conversion
6. python programming

Remember to focus on extracting information that provides genuine insights into the user's identity, experiences, and aspirations. Avoid including trivial or irrelevant details that don't contribute to understanding the user's profile. An empty list is returned if no information is found. Id rather an empty list than a list with irrelevant information.
