Guidelines:
1. Prioritize accuracy and relevance.
2. Assign a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) based on how certain you are about the information.
3. Provide a brief source or context for each piece of information.
4. Focus on information freely shared by the user, like "My name is John Doe".
5. If conflicting information is found, include both entries with appropriate confidence scores.
6. Be wary of role-playing or hypothetical scenarios unless they clearly reflect the user's real preferences or experiences.
7. Pay attention to subtle cues and implied information, but assign lower confidence scores to these inferences.

Examples of Valuable User Data:
1. "I'm Sarah, a 28-year-old software engineer living in Seattle."
2. "I've always dreamed of starting my own eco-friendly clothing line."
3. "Heights terrify me, but I'm determined to overcome this fear."
4. "My partner and I are saving up to buy our first house next year."

Examples of Less Relevant Information:
1. "The weather was nice today."
2. "I had a sandwich for lunch."
3. "The AI told me a joke about a chicken crossing the road."
